priority: major

component: Website

milestone: $SRYYYY Competition Cleanup

description: >-
  The post-competition news article can take some time to write. We should
  write a skeleton one as soon as possible, and just fill in the blanks
  immediately after the competition followed by high-speed review and
  shipping.

  Once published we should link various people to the article, including:
  - Our social media accounts
  - Various tech/STEM blogs and other media outlets (we should email them)

dependencies:
  - comp/venue/book
