    This ticket relates to providing the actual machines that will be
    used by the score entry volunteers.

    Typically one of these will be a fairly permanent role and thus the
    volunteer can probably just use their laptop. The other position
    tends to be a rotating job so we need a fixed machine which each
    person can use. This avoids needing to configure the software on
    each new person's machine when they start.
