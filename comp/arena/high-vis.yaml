summary: Organise high-vis jackets for the teams at the competition

component: Arena

milestone: $SRYYYY Competition

description: >-
    For SR2015 each team was given a high-vis jacket. The idea was that
    the person wearing the jacket was the one "responsible" for that
    team's robot and was the only one who could enter the staging area.
    The jackets were also adorned with the TLA for the team.

    This worked very well as it reduced the number of people in the
    staging area while making it exceedingly clear who to talk to about
    each robot.

    We could consider putting our logo on them, though this probably
    isn't needed as the teams tend to decorate them anyway.

    We therefore need to:
    - purchase $N_TEAMS jackets
    - ensure they are marked up with the teams' TLAs
