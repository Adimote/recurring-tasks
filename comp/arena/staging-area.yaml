summary: Put out the staging area

component: Arena

milestone: $SRYYYY Competition Day

description: |
    Build the staging area for the arenas, where the teams will attach
    and remove the robot-badges and competition-mode USB keys.

    This should be designed as a one-way system, and include two sets of
    tables:
    * for the robots to placed on while waiting for their match (which
      should have sections labelled per-arena and -corner), used to mount
      the robot badges and for inspection if needed
    * for the robots to be placed on after a match to have their badges
      removed

    The second set of tables should also have a storage area for the
    badges and USB keys, arranged such that it's clear which ones are
    present. A volunteer should be assigned to managed this.
