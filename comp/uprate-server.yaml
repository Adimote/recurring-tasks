summary: Uprate saffron _before_ the competition starts

priority: major

component: Competition

milestone: $SRYYYY Competition

description: >-
    During week preceding and particularly over the competition weekend
    our main server gets a lot more load than it normally does. The
    easiest way to ensure that it can cope is to temporarily uprate its
    capacity with the hosting provider over the competition period.

    In the past we've gone up one level on the weekend before and then
    up another level for the weekend itself.
