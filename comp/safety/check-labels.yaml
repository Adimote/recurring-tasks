summary: Print safety-check labels for $SRYYYY

priority: major

component: Competition

milestone: $SRYYYY Competition

description: >-
  We need labels to stick onto each robot to show that it has passed a
  safety-check. For SR2014, these included the team TLA, the words
  "Safety Checked" plus some boxes for the time of the check and the
  initials of the person who did the check. These will need modifying to
  include the current year and then printing on to stick labels.
