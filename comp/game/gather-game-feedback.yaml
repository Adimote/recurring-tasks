priority: minor

component: Competition

milestone: $SRYYYY Competition

description: >-
  During the competition (or preferably near the end) some feedback should be
  collected from the competing teams on the game. 
  
  Here are some ideas of what information to ask for:
  - How fair is the game?
  - Do you think it's easy to score a few points and hard to score a lot 
    of points?
  - Is the game interesting to watch?
  - Did you find it easy to prototype the game?
  - Is each match too long/short?
  - Are you okay with the number of matches you had, and the gap between them?
  - Does the game give you a good enough mechanical & eletronics challenge?
