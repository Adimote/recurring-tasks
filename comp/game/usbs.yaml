summary: Prepare competition-mode USB keys

priority: major

milestone: $SRYYYY Competition

description: >-
  During matches the robots need a mechanism to know which corner they're
  in and to ensure that they can only see the proper libkoki markers.

  In SR2015 this was solved by using a set of competition-mode USB keys
  which the teams plugged into their robots.

  We need two sets of each key; one for the robot currently playing,
  one for the robot currently preparing. They will be kept in the
  staging-area.
