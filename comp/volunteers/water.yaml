summary: Ensure we can get refreshments to static volunteers.

priority: major

component: Competition

milestone: $SRYYYY Competition

description: >-
    Many volunteers are in a single place and cannot move because
    they are continuously active for a long duration (linesman, judges). For
    those volunteers it'd be nice if we could get water to them easily. This
    will probably require a person who can run water, possibly someone with a
    low bandwidth job. TODO: work out who that person is.
