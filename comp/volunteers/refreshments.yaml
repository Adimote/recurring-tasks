description: >-
  We should have some refreshments for the volunteers at the competition.  At a
  minimum this will include water and cups being available at all times
  throughout the competition including the setup day. Being dehydrated at the
  competition is awful. It would be nice if we could get tea, coffee, and
  biscuits as well.
