summary: Prepare battery charging station

priority: major

component: Competition

milestone: $SRYYYY Competition

description: >-
  There are many batteries that need charging and we need to set up the
  charging station at helpdesk or nearby.

  Note: the battery charging station should reconfigure the chargers to
  a higher current than we allow the teams to use as this substantially
  reduces the charge time. Instructions on how to do this should be made
  available to those running the charging station.
