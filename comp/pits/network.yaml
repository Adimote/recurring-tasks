summary: Roll out networking to the team pits

priority: major

component: Competition

milestone: $SRYYYY Competition

description: >-
  Teams need access to the internet to use the IDE and get at
  documentation. We therefore need network access in all the team pits.

  Past experience has shown that each pit ''needs'' a hard-wire Ethernet
  connection, even if we aim to provide WiFi coverage as well. The setup
  in SR2015 where each pit had a cable plus each group of (four) pits
  had a WiFi router worked fairly well.
