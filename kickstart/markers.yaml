summary: Create markers for the $SRYYYY game

priority: major

component: Rules

milestone: $SRYYYY Kickstart

description: >-
    In the past we've had repos which contain all the generated markers
    for a given year. The contents of such a repo needs updating for
    $SRYYYY, and the dev markers need adding to the website.

    Obviously this can't happen until we've decided what the names of
    the markers will be.

dependencies:
    - kickstart/update-api
